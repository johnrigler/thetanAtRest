This is a hack. In many ways, this file is the README. The actual README.md file is not intented to be read by a person-- but rather read by chatGPT.
By formatting this repo in a certain way, something incredible can happen. This repo can act as a conversational seed. The "prompt" file shows how to start the process.
Just paste the prompt into chatGPT and you are off to the races. It is seed a conversation and then share it, or simply share the prompt. 

It isn't possible to have a generic "chatSeed" repo with multiple prompt seeds. It only really words in this format because of soft limitations with how chatGPT is
able to read github.
